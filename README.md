# Sentiment-Analysis-With-PySpark
## Introduction
Nowadays, online shopping has become more and more popular. The main advantages of online shopping are that it is much more convenient, and arguably less time consuming. When using online shopping, customers do not have to care about opening hours of the stores or malls, or the weather outside. Besides, they do not spend lots of time trying different stuffs before deciding what to buy. With online shopping, customers can make orders online, wait for them to come, try them and can return them if they are not satisfied. Very convenient and fast indeed! From my own experience, I use online shopping all the time and spend less and less time going to brick and mortar stores. One of the things that help me tremendously in shopping online (other than free shipping, returns and sale-offs throughout the year) is reviews from other customers. Those reviews can be images of the real products, or several sentences showing how good/ bad the products are. They really help online shoppers like me to be more confident when purchasing something. 
Nevertheless, customerâ€™s review is not only useful in the retail industry. It has become very valuable in other industries such as entertainment (movies/ music reviews) or foods and beverages (restaurant reviews). As more people use reviews (both writing and reading), there are more platforms for that: IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, TripAdvisor, Yelp, just to name a few.

## Objectives
In this project, my main objectives are:
1.	Become familiar with the PySpark API, using the Spark SQL (DataFrame) for data munging and analysis, and implementing simple machine learning models with the Spark MLLib.
2.	Learn techniques that can be applied to text classification. 
The Yelp dataset on Kaggle is suitable for various data science/machine learning research: from exploratory data analysis, data visualization to machine learning modeling techniques.
